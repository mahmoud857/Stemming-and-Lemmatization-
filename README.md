# Stemming-and-Lemmatization-
Practical application to the most popular algorithms used in stemming and lemmatization

# Introduction
Stemming and lemmatization are text normalization techniques used in NLP to reduce words to their base forms. While stemming cuts off prefixes or suffixes to approximate the root, lemmatization uses vocabulary and morphological analysis to return the base or dictionary form of a word (lemma).

This project provides practical examples of how to apply these techniques using popular algorithms and libraries.
